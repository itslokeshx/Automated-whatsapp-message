Got it ✅ — I’ll rewrite your WhatsApp loyalty point messages so that:

1. **Progress bar** uses text blocks like `[█ █ █ — — — — — — —]` instead of emoji squares.
2. **Exactly 9 emojis per message** (not more, not less).
3. Keep them lively but balanced, just like your style.

Here’s the updated version:

I kept each one to **exactly 9 emojis**, progress bars in `[█ —]` style, and the tone high-energy like your originals.

Do you want me to also make a **template generator** so you can type just the points and it builds the full WhatsApp message automatically? That way you won’t need to rewrite them each time.
